The ways that twisty puzzles move are mathematically well defined, and can be generalized to higher spatial dimensions. These puzzles can then be visualized and simulated using computer software.</p> <p>The most well known 4D shape is the hypercube (also called the tesseract, 8-cell, octachoron, or 4-cube). It has 8 cubic sides that are called cells. Turning any of the cells involves rotating it like a cube to any of 24 orientations.</p> <p>Another definition of hypercubing is \u201cbeyond cubing.\u201d This includes all manner of exotic twisty puzzles beyond the handful of puzzles solved by most speedcubers.</p> <p>The short article Abstracting Rubik\u2019s Cube introduces a number of the hypercubing puzzles.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Welcome!

For example, we call an <code>x</code> rotation x because it rotates the puzzle \u201caround the x-axis\u201d. However, this is unhelpful because rotations don\u2019t actually happen around an axis. Instead it\u2019s better to think of rotations as happening within a 2D plane. When you\u2019re doing an <code>x</code>, the whole puzzle is really being rotated within the zy plane. And writing rotations like this generalizes to higher dimensions, so that is what we use.</p> <p>First, we make a certain side from each axis be the \u201cpositive\u201d side. There are standards for this in 3D (such as the right-handed rule). On the x-axis, going to the right is positive and going left is negative. This makes <code>R</code> the positive side from the x-axis. The same goes for the other axes: <code>U</code>, and <code>F</code> are the positive sides in 3D. In 4D we add two new sides, and have to decide which one is positive and which one is negative. Because of the projection, the side that we can\u2019t see is closer to the 4D camera, making <code>O</code> the positive w-axis cell, and <code>I</code> the negative.</p> <p>To actually notate the rotations, write the letters of the two axes that form the plane that the puzzle is rotating in, in the order of which positive side on that axis goes to the positive side of the other axis. For example: rotating the positive y-axis side to the positive x-axis side (rotating U to R) would be written <code>yx</code> (and looks like <code>z</code> in 3D notation).</p> <ul> <li><code>yw</code>: bring +y to +w (rotate U to O)</li> <li><code>xz</code>: bring +x to +z (rotate R to F (this is called <code>y</code> in 3D rotation notation))</li> </ul> <p>Note how we don\u2019t have to use the <code>'</code> prime symbol because you can just swap the letters (wy is the inverse of yw). You can also add a <code>2</code> to the end for double rotations, e.g. <code>wx2</code>, <code>yz2</code> etc.</p> <p>This makes it a really nice system because it only ever uses two letters, no matter how many dimensions. You can also use it on n<sup>3</sup> puzzles in order for more multi-dimensional consistency: <code>xy</code> means move x+ to y+ (R to U [z\u2019 rotation]).</p>"},{"location":"notation/#turn-metrics","title":"Turn metrics","text":"<p>There are many different ways to count the number of twists performed during a solve.

Cherto had heard of the Shrine of Manifestation, where the Priests of High Symmetry imbue 4-dimensional or even 5-dimensional symmetry unto ordinary 3-dimensional shapes, and decided to try their hand at designing such a spell. They had counted the stickers and the pieces of a 4D puzzle, and had constructed a 3D shape with the same stickers.</p> <p>Master Nazir, having been presented with the neophyte\u2019s design, sighed deeply and gently shook his head as they walked through the garden together.</p> <p>\u201cYoung neophyte, how will the pieces twist? Have you accounted for the orientations of each piece? Do they change according to the moves?\u201d</p> <p>Neophyte Cherto scrambled to fix the issues. \u201cWell we can adjust the orientation of the pieces after each twist!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how, young neophyte, is that any better a puzzle than the soup we eat for lunch?\u201d</p> <p>Cherto\u2019s face fell.

It appeared in the form of an ordinary 3x3x3, but with an odd coating on the stickers that presented a gradient over each piece that tilted strangely as she observed it from different angles. She took the cube and scrambled it, intending to return it once she had solved it.</p> <p>As she twisted the puzzle, she became sure that it was playing tricks on her. Even whole-puzzle rotations seemed to behave oddly. She had placed a blue piece next to an orange piece, but upon spinning the puzzle in her hands, the blue piece became orange and the orange piece had become blue! After struggling for a half-hour, managing only to pair a handful of pieces, she resolved to find Master Eiji, who was an expert in variations of the 3x3x3.</p> <p>Upon showing the mysterious puzzle to Master Eiji, he led her inside to a bare room with a column in the center. \u201cWalk around the column and return to me. Then you shall learn how to solve this puzzle,\u201d he instructed. Quenta gave him a quizzical look, but then walked around the column\u2013 and found that Master Eiji had disappeared! Furthermore, the room was slightly different; she could not see the entrance they had come in from, and instead there sat a bench against the wall. She walked another full circle around the column, and then found Master Eiji.</p> <p>\u201cMaster Eiji!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhat strange geometry is this room constructed from?

In October 2021, rudimentary 4D support was added and a screenshot was posted on the Hypercubers Discord server. A month later, Rowan Fortier asked Hactar if he could receive an early version of the program, and showcased it in a YouTube video. Shortly before the video\u2019s release, the project was renamed to Hyperspeedcube.</p> <p> </p> <p>The first official release was v0.1.0 in January 2022, featuring customizable keybinds and support for the 3<sup>3</sup> and 3<sup>4</sup>. Over the next year, many community-requested features were added, including mouse controls and more n<sup>3</sup> and n<sup>4</sup> puzzles. (See the changelog for a complete list of releases and changes.)</p> <p>Hyperspeedcube began to see widespread use after the addition of mouse controls and more advanced piece filters in August 2022, kickstarting the hyperspeedsolving revolution. The web version was released in January 2023.</p> <p>Shortly after the web version was released, Hactar and Luna began reading the MPU source code, intending to make a tool to ease the process of writing MPU puzzle definitions. Instead, they were able to replicate MPU\u2019s puzzle generation algorithms, and Hactar set to work on a new puzzle simulator using this backend. Over the next year, they adapted the algorithm to use Conformal Geometric Algebra in the hopes of supporting curved cuts, but this proved too challenging in higher dimensions. Together with Milo, they built a puzzle definition system using Lua, since it is a well-known programming language with a simple type system that is easy to embed, sandbox, and extend with custom types.</p> <p>The first dev build of the new version, Hyperspeedcube v2.0.0-pre.1, was released on July 16th, 2023, and supported Lua shape definitions but not twists.

The first known description of this technique was by John Conway in 1979, but is most commonly credited to Jessica Fridrich due to the massive popularity her website describing the CFOP method had in the early 1990s.</p> <p>The goal of this page is to give you a generalized understanding of higher dimensional F2L, not to hand out algorithms for certain cases. There are so many cases for higher dimensional F2L that it would be nearly impossible to list out all the cases. It\u2019s recommended to have a fairly strong intuitive understanding of 3D F2L before reading this page.</p> <p>Dimensional Analogy</p> <p>In 3D F2L, whenever you twist a side axis, a 1x1x3 block of pieces (containing the F2L slot) goes to the top layer (essentially a 1D line). In 4 dimensions, 2 adjacent sides intersect at a 2D plane. So when you do a twist you\u2019re bringing a 1x1x3x3 block to the top layer, which contains 3 F2L pairs: that being two F2L-b slots and an F2L-a slot. This makes inserting a single pair trickier, because now you need to use more moves to not disturb the other two subslots.</p> <p>Continuing this analogy into 5D, you bring a whole 3D cube\u2019s worth of F2L slots to the top (1x1x3x3x3) that you mustn\u2019t disturb while inserting a single pair. This pattern continues for higher and higher dimensions, meaning that it gets trickier to insert a single pair. Pro solvers of higher dimensional puzzles will wait until they have 3 (or multiples of 3) pairs, then pairs all those pairs into a gigapair, and then insert that gigapair like inserting a lower dimensional pair.</p> <p>Terminology</p> <p>To talk about F2L in a dimensionally neutral way, we need some more terms. Most importantly, the following:</p> <ul> <li>Head: the piece in the pair with the most colours (corner in 3D)</li> <li>Body: the piece in the pair with one less colour (edge in 3D)</li> </ul> <p>For more terms, see the glossary.</p> <p>Regardless of dimension and type of pair, they are broken down into the following categories:</p> <ol> <li>both in top, head facing side axes</li> <li>both in top, head facing top axis</li> <li>body in slot, head in top facing side axis</li> <li>body in slot, head in top facing top axis</li> <li>head in slot facing side axis, body in top</li> <li>head in slot facing base axis, body in top</li> <li>both stuck in slot</li> </ol>"},{"location":"techniques/F2L/#f2l-4a","title":"F2L-4a","text":"<p>F2L-a pairs consist of a 2c and a 3c, exactly the same as in 3D.

In turn, creating a commutator with those sequences makes it easier to solve a puzzle by only affecting a few specific pieces at a time.</p> <p>One of the earliest solutions for the 3x3x3x3 was The Ultimate Solution to a 3x3x3x3 by Roice Nelson, which made heavy use of intuitive setup moves and commutators.

Below is a simple 3 step guide to translate your algorithms into RKT.</p> <p>Example: Sune algorithm with RKT</p> <p>Say you want to do the Sune algorithm <code>R U R' U R U2 R'</code> with RKT. The first step is to try and think of how you can execute the algorithm using only R moves and cube rotations. <code>R U R' U R U2 R'</code> becomes <code>R z R z' R' z R z' R z R2 z' R'</code>.

It takes a lot of practice to get comfortable with RKT, but it is an extremely powerful technique.</p> <p>The best way to learn RKT before doing your first 3<sup>4</sup> solve is by manually scrambling the last cell using any RO moves and random I cell rotations until it looks scrambled. Then practice doing PLC by solving it with RKT.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Even though this technique is called RKT, it is not limited to those types of turns. Thus, you can use LO and I- moves instead, or rotate your view and use RU and D- instead of RK and I-.</p> <p>Another popular way to do RKT is to use wide O cell turns (instead of normal I cell turns). This has the benefit of keeping the cell you\u2019re doing RKT to in the same orientation the entire time. Instead of rotating a side of the I cell to the RI plane, you rotate all the outside layers over the side that you\u2019re twisting.</p>"},{"location":"techniques/rkt/#parity","title":"Parity","text":"<p>RKT Parity</p> <p></p> <p>RKT parity is a state you can get to that appears to rotate a single layer of a cell by 180\u00b0.

HactarCE made a program called RocKeT to find cancels for 3<sup>4</sup> algorithms. Often, it just involves inserting some flipping moves at certain points throughout the algorithm.</p> <p>Consider <code>R U R' U'</code>. Conventional RKT rotates after every move, but we don\u2019t have to do that many rotations. We can build up multiple moves of RKT debt and then cancel them later:</p> <ul> <li><code>RO UO</code> \u2014 do <code>R U</code> using RKT, building up two moves of RKT debt (<code>R U</code>)</li> <li><code>IF RO'</code> \u2014 do <code>R'</code> using RKT, undoing the debt from <code>U</code></li> <li><code>IF2 UO'</code> \u2014 do <code>U'</code> using RKT, undoing the debt from the <code>R</code></li> </ul> <p>But we can do even better!</p> <ul> <li><code>RO UO</code> \u2014 do <code>R U</code> using RKT</li> <li><code>IUR</code> \u2014 swap <code>R</code> with <code>U</code></li> <li><code>UO' RO'</code> \u2014 do <code>R' U'</code> using RKT (because we swapped <code>R</code> and <code>U</code>), undoing the debt from <code>R U</code></li> </ul> <p>You might notice that this is a conjugate <code>[RO UO: IUR]</code>. This corresponds to the fact that <code>R U R' U'</code> can be written as a conjugate where one part is a pure rotation: <code>[R U: z x2]</code>. When executing this algorithm, we apply it to <code>I</code> with the rotation (so it\u2019s equivalent to <code>R U R' U'</code>) and to the outer layers without the rotation (so <code>[RU: _]</code> expands to <code>R U U' R'</code>, which completely cancels out). This is the fundamental theory behind how to do RKT cancels: by rewriting algorithms as conjugates and commutators with pure rotations.</p> <p>Recall how in 3D you can replace a <code>U y'</code> with <code>Dw</code>. We can do the same thing here: replace <code>IUR</code> with <code>{1-2}OUR</code>, which is a rotation of the outer layers instead of the inner layers. Now it just looks like a normal algorithm with a flip thrown in the middle: <code>RO UO {1-2}OUR RO' UO'</code>. So we can notate it a little more simply: <code>R U {1-2}OUR R' U'</code></p> <p>Here\u2019s a more complex example, the Sune algorithm: <code>RO UO RO' {1-2}OUR UO RO {1-2}OUR UO2 RO'</code>. This algorithm works because you can rewrite Sune using conjugates with rotations: <code>[R U: [R': z x2] [U: z x2]]</code>.

Another interesting way to do this is in a method like Belt Method. After solving the belt, orienting opposite sides, and separating the colours, the user is left with solving 2 opposite cells that can be solved simultaneously using RKT. If you turn one of the sides with the belt going through it, it essentially does a twist to both cells. One case that can be annoying is if you want to do a 180\u00b0 turn on one side, and a 90\u00b0 turn on the other (you would have to wait until both cells\u2019 debt lined up).</p>"},{"location":"techniques/rkt/#higher-dimensional-rkt","title":"Higher Dimensional RKT","text":"<p>The term 2RKT or Double RKT is used to refer to using RKT to do RKT in 5D puzzles.

After turning a layer, we want subsequent turns to be noncancelling (turning the same layer twice can be written as a single move), so we have \\(276-23=253\\) choices for subsequent turns.</p> <p>From here, we can proceed without the Winning Ways improvement, where we find the number of positions reachable by 50 turns or fewer is at most</p> \\[1 + 276 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{49}253^k \\approx 1.57 \\times 10^{120} &lt; \\frac{\\left(24!\\times 2^{24}\\right) \\times \\left(32! \\times 6^{32}\\right) \\times (16! \\times 12^{16})}{48} \\approx 1.78 \\times 10^{120}.\\] <p>This shows there are positions on the \\(3^4\\) which require 51 turns or more to solve. In the book Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays Vol. 4, the authors optimize this argument (as it applies to the Rubik\u2019s Cube in the half turn metric) by accounting for relations like \\(LR = RL\\). We can apply a similar optimization for the \\(3^4\\).</p> <p>We will refer to the set of possible new positions reachable after exactly \\(n\\) turns as \\(T_n\\). \u201cNew\u201d here means that \\(T_n\\) does not include positions that were in \\(T_{n-1}\\). \u201cExactly\u201d means that positions reachable in more than \\(n\\) turns are not in \\(T_n\\). The number of elements in \\(T_n\\) is \\(|T_n|\\).</p> <p>By the computation from before, there are 276 distinct puzzle states after a single turn. So \\(|T_1|=276\\). Finding \\(|T_2|\\) is more complicated. First, we need to setup a more detailed way of describing turning axes.</p> <p>A primary axis is a line through the core of a puzzle in any of the four cardinal directions. Primary axes have three layers, which we might label \\(-1,\\ 0,\\) and \\(1\\). The white-yellow primary axis\u2019 three primary layers would correspond to the yellow cell (\\(-y\\)), white cell (\\(y\\)), and the slice between the white and yellow cells. A \\textbf{secondary} axis is a line through the center of a facet and any of the pieces in that facet. Importantly, the secondary axis can be described using a single cardinal direction when it is through a ridge piece (the \\(90^\\circ\\) degree cell turns and their doubles). A primary axis, secondary axis, and an angle which we turn by is enough to describe any turn in the STM.</p> <p>We have just 253 noncancelling choices for a second turn. Some of these second turns commute with a first turn, which means we will overcount positions reachable by two algorithms differing by the order of commuting turns. Noncancelling commuting pairs of turns can happen in two ways:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The first and second turns happen in the same primary axis and on different layers (for example, \\(UO\\ \\ \\{2\\}UO' = \\{2\\}UO'\\ \\ UO\\).\\</p> </li> <li> <p>The first turn has primary and secondary axes \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second turn has primary and secondary axes \\(b\\) and \\(a\\)  (for example, \\(OL\\ LO= LO\\ OL\\)).</p> </li> </ol> <p>In describing commuting cases of the first kind, the second turn is one that happens on the same primary axis as the first and on a different layer. There are two other layers, and we can make one of \\(23\\) turns on that layer. This means that after a single turn is made, \\(2\\times 23 = 46\\) of the following turns may lead to commuting cases of the first kind. However, two of these actually lead to single turn puzzle states (like \\(UO\\ \\{2\\}UO = DO\\)) which were counted in \\(T_1\\) and should not be part of \\(T_2\\). So, only 44 of these turns lead to distinct new puzzle states. This means there are \\(\\frac{44\\times 276}{2}\\) distinct new puzzle states reachable by two commuting moves of this first kind.</p> <p>Commuting cases of the second kind can only happen if the first turn\u2019s secondary axis goes through a ridge piece. There are \\(108\\) turns like this. The second turn\u2019s primary/secondary axes are determined by transposing the first turn\u2019s primary/secondary axes, and then can happen in one of three ways on one of three layers. So, we have \\(\\frac{9\\times 108}{2}\\) distinct new puzzle states reachable by two commuting moves of this second kind. NOTE: If the first turn is one of the \\(276-108= 168\\) other turns that cannot be followed by a commuting turn of the second kind, those nine second turns happen on a different primary axis and will neither cancel nor commute.</p> <p>Now we can compute an upper bound on \\(|T_2|\\). There are \\(\\frac{44\\times 276}{2}\\) distinct new puzzle states reachable by two commuting moves of the first kind, and \\(\\frac{9\\times 108}{2}\\) distinct new puzzle states reachable by two commuting moves of the second kind. There are \\(276-23-44-9=200\\) noncancelling, noncommuting second turns. In total, we have \\(|T_2| \\leq \\frac{44\\times 276}{2} + \\frac{9\\times 108}{2} + 9\\times 168 + 200\\times 276 = 63,270\\). As mentioned in the \u201cNOTE\u201d, following one of the other 168 first moves (with secondary axis \\textit{not} through a ridge piece) with one of those nine turns suggested by commuting case of the second kind will never cancel or commute, so we add \\(9\\times 168\\) to complement the \u201cleftovers\u201d that were ignored in the \\(\\frac{9\\times 108}{2}\\) term.</p> <p>To complete the argument, we can derive a recurrence relation (more accurately a recurrence estimate) that gives an upper bound on the size of \\(|T_{n+2}|\\) in terms of \\(|T_n|\\) and \\(|T_{n+1}|\\).</p> <p>In the case where the \\(n+2\\)th turn will not commute or cancel with the \\(n+1\\)th turn, we have at most \\(9\\times 168|T_{n}| + 200\\times |T_{n+1}|\\) possible puzzle states.

It is worth noting that in the estimate from the beginning (with few optimizations), the actual value of the sum on the LHS is quite close to the number of scrambles possible on the \\(3^4\\) (within the same order of magnitude). Compare this to our new estimate, where the sum is bounded above by a number two orders of magnitude smaller than the number of scrambles possible on the \\(3^4\\). So as we would have expected, our improvements do reduce the size of the estimate, just not quite enough to bring down the number of turns derived.</p> <p>Below is an example of a similar argument used to derive a lower bound of 56 turns in the OBTM. Note that this argument is missing some optimizations that were applied in the STM lower bound derivation.</p> OBTM Lower Bound, Winning Ways Method <p>Moves here will be measured using something equivalent (as far as this discussion is concerned) to OBTM. Our focus here is on positions that can be reached by algorithms of a certain length. Wide moves contribute to algorithm length in the same way that single cell turns do (wide move = single cell move + cube rotation, where cube rotations count as 0 moves), so we will make a simplification by restricting to single cell turns. There are 23 moves on each of the 8 cells, so 184 one-move algorithms are possible at any given time.</p> <p>We know the 3<sup>4</sup> can be scrambled in over 1.7 novemtrigintillion ways.

It is not too hard to convince ourselves that \\(u_1 = 184\\). After turning one cell, moving the same cell again is what we might call a \u201ccancelling move\u201d, since the two moves could have been measured as a single move. So, we have \\(161\\) non cancelling choices for a second move. We should be able to reduce that \\(161\\) further by avoiding double counting positions reachable by two algorithms which differ only by the order of commuting elements.</p> <p>There are different ways that a pair of moves can commute on 3<sup>4</sup>. One is by the cell turns affecting completely distinct subsets of pieces, which happens when turning opposite cells, like \\(OL\\ IL = IL\\ OL\\). This is analogous to the commuting cases on the Rubik\u2019s Cube as addressed in Winning Ways. There is at least one more way, which can involve certain adjacent cell moves. \\(OL\\ LO = LO\\ OL\\) is one example. We have not yet reached a description of all commuting cases of this kind. Accounting for these may allow us to further improve the lower bound. For now, we will factor out the commutativities that we can describe, which we will call \u201copposite-commuting\u201d moves.</p> <p>First, there are \\(161-23 = 138\\) possible non-cancelling, non-opposite-commuting choices for the second move. We\u2019ll add the opposite-commuting cases separately.</p> <p>There are four \u201cflavors\u201d of opposite-commuting cases: I cell moves with O cell moves, R moves with L moves, U moves with D moves, and B moves with F moves. In any of these, choose any one of the 23 moves possible on each cell (order doesn\u2019t matter), so there are \\(23 \\times 23 = 529\\) opposite-commuting cases of each flavor. Then across the four flavors, we have \\(529\\times 4 = 2,116\\) distinct cases after the second move, when it opposite-commuted with the first. So we have that the number of \\(3^4\\) positions after \\(n\\) moves is at most \\(138u_1 + 2,116 = 27,508\\). That is, we can say \\(u_2 \\leq 27,508\\).</p> <p>As a sanity check, we could note at this point the \\(27,508\\) positions after two turns is better than the \\(184\\times 161 = 29,624\\) positions we would have estimated without accounting for opposite-commutativity of two successive turns here.</p> <p>To complete the argument, we can derive a recurrence relation (more accurately a recurrence estimate) that gives us an upper bound on the size of \\(u_{n+2}\\) in terms of \\(u_n\\) and \\(u_{n+1}\\)</p> <p>In the case where the \\(n+2\\)th move will not opposite-commute (or cancel) with the \\(n+1\\)th move, we have \\(138u_{n+1}\\) possible puzzle states. If the \\(n+2\\)th move is going to opposite-commute with the \\(n+1\\)th move, we might have \\(529\\times 4 = 2,116\\) cases to follow up the \\(n\\)th move. However, one of those four flavors of opposite commuting cases would have cancelled with the \\(n\\)th move, so this time we only have \\(529 \\times 3 = 1,587\\) cases to follow the \\(n\\)th move. This gives us the recurrence estimate \\(u_{n+2} \\leq 138u_{n+1} + 1,587u_{n}\\).</p> <p>Note that as we have defined it, \\(u_n\\) is the number of positions accessible by exactly \\(n\\) moves.

A physical puzzle built like this must have pieces that can represent that symmetry group.</p>"},{"location":"theory/physical/#melindas-24","title":"Melinda\u2019s 2<sup>4</sup>","text":"<p>The 2<sup>4</sup> has 16 pieces, each with 4 stickers. By performing moves on a virtual 2<sup>4</sup>, a piece can be brought back to its position with any even permutation of stickers. (It is not just the monoflip because that assumes the rest of the puzzle is solved, which is not important here.) In three dimensions, a tetrahedron with its four vertices representing the stickers has the same symmetry. (This is not a coincidence; a 2<sup>4</sup> built on the surface of a hypersphere will have its pieces be spherical tetrahedra with the stickers at the vertices.) Thus, the pieces of Melinda\u2019s 2<sup>4</sup> have tetrahedral symmetry.</p> <p>This is not the only design decision resulting in a usable physical puzzle. Since the pieces of the 2<sup>4</sup> can be arranged in two cubic layers, the pieces are cubes to allow them to stick together in this fashion. This makes many of the moves simply rotating one whole cube of 8 pieces, and the others rotate 4 pieces from each layer in a simple way. These moves are unable to swap a white or yellow sticker with a sticker of a different color, which means the puzzle simulates a cubic prism puzzle: a 2<sup>3</sup>x2<sup>1</sup> cuboid, where the first three axes can turn into each other but the last one cannot in the same way that a 3x3x3x2 is restricted.</p> <p>The virtual 2<sup>4</sup>, on the other hand, does allow moves that take a white or yellow sticker to a sticker of a different color, and the pieces were designed so that this operation is possible. It would be possible to observe those moves, record which piece goes where, and apply that to the physical 2<sup>4</sup>, but this is unwieldy. Instead, Melinda introduced a gyro, a sequence of actions that does the equivalent of a whole-puzzle rotation on the virtual puzzle, but takes a white sticker to a sticker on a different axis. Thus, other moves are accessible by performing the gyro followed by a simple move. On this puzzle, a gyro is usually about six physical twisting actions, but on other puzzles, they can be more complicated, so finding a puzzle that supports a short gyro is valuable.</p>"},{"location":"theory/physical/#restricted-25","title":"Restricted 2<sup>5</sup>","text":"<p>The pieces of a virtual 2<sup>5</sup> have 60 orientations, the even permutations of its 5 stickers. It is difficult to design a piece with this symmetry, so the restricted 2<sup>5</sup> sets one axis to be unswappable with the others, i.e. it is a 2<sup>4</sup>x2<sup>1</sup> in the notation of the previous section. This means the pieces only need to be able to evenly permute 4 of their stickers, which is the same symmetry as the pieces of the physical 2<sup>4</sup>. The pieces from that can thus be reused to build the restricted 2<sup>5</sup>, with one sticker added to each piece. The extra sticker needs to be invariant under all rotations of the piece, so it needs to be applied to every face of the piece.</p> <p>The design of the puzzle is simple: two copies of the physical 2<sup>4</sup>, where the legal moves are doing a whole puzzle rotation on one, doing the same twist on both, or swapping 8 pieces from each half by twisting a side of the puzzle.

However, the only discrete chiral point groups in 3 dimensions of order 360 all contain a rotation by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{90}\\), which has order 180. \\(A_6\\) has no elements of order 180, so none of these point groups are isomorphic to \\(A_6\\), and a physical 2<sup>6</sup> with rigid pieces is impossible.

This enlarges the symmetry group of the piece from \\(A_4\\) to \\(S_4\\), the symmetric group on 4 points. Fortunately, octahedral symmetry acts on the four space diagonals of a cube by \\(S_4\\), and one endpoint from each diagonal corresponds to the vertices of a tetrahedron, used for the stickers on the 2<sup>4</sup>. Therefore, the 4-stickers can be placed on opposite corners of a cube. The stickers on the periphery of the pieces correspond to the 2-stickers, which swap whenever the piece is rotated in a way that does not preserve the original tetrahedron, i.e. one that does an odd permutation.
