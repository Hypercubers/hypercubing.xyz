# A Gentle Introduction

!!! warning "This series is under construction"

This series is an introduction to [grip theory](../grip-theory.md) that requires only high school math knowledge.

Grip theory is a framework for analyzing many different kinds of twisty puzzles in a geometry-independent way. It was [first developed on the TwistyPuzzles forum in 2009](https://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=15667), and has since been further developed by the members of the Hypercubers Discord, particularly [Milo Jacquet](https://milojacquet.com/) and [Mniip](https://mniip.com/). Grip theory was originally used to describe doctrinaire puzzles in 3D, but it can be extended to describe bandaged puzzles, jumbling puzzles, higher-dimensional puzzles, and more.

Grip theory is built on [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory), which is itself built on [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory). This series explains just the fundamentals of each of those, enough to understand grip theory.
