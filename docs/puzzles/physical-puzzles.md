# Physical Puzzles

!!! warning
    It is highly recommended to learn [virtual hypercubing](\wiki\software) first before trying to understand the physical puzzles.

Physical puzzles refer to higher dimensional puzzles that are physically built in real life (using only 3 dimensions). This often involves clever designs, strange symmetry-abusing tricks, and lots and lots of magnets. Often, these puzzles are too impractical to use, defeating their sole purpose.
