# Physical Puzzles

!!! warning
    It is highly recommended to learn how [virtual puzzles](/puzzles/index.md) work first before trying to understand the physical puzzles. See [Why not start with the physical 2×2×2×2?](/faq.md#why-not-start-with-the-physical-2222).

Physical puzzles refer to higher dimensional puzzles that are physically built in real life (using only 3 dimensions). This involves clever designs, strange symmetry-abusing tricks, and lots and lots of magnets. Often, these puzzles are too impractical to use, defeating their sole purpose. For an explanation of how these puzzles work, see [the theory page](/theory/physical.md).

For a documentary about the history of physical puzzles as of December 2022, see [Rowan's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTc-rG-nunA).
