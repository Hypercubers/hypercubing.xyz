Physical puzzles refer to higher dimensional puzzles that are physically built in real life (using only 3 dimensions). This involves clever designs, strange symmetry-abusing tricks, and lots and lots of magnets. Often, these puzzles are too impractical to use, defeating their sole purpose.

For a documentary about the history of physical puzzles as of December 2022, see [Rowan's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTc-rG-nunA).
