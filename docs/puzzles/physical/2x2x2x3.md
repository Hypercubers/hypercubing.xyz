    **4D Shape:** Hypercuboid

    **Physical Shape:** Rectangular prism

    **Pieces:** 16 4c, 8 3c

    **Magnets:** 1152

    **Completed:** 2022 Feb 3

Grant's 2×2×2×3 is a physical 4D twisty puzzle that was designed and 3D printed by [Grant S](/leaderboards/solvers/grant.md). It works almost the same as its virtual counterpart, with the restrictions of only certain moves being canonical, plus the extra gyro algorithms needed to rotate the puzzle 4 dimensionally.

## History

In December of 2021, Melinda green posted this image to the Hypercubers Discord server, jokingly calling it a 2×2×2×3:

Afterwards, Luna started sketching out some ideas of possible layouts for an actual 2×2×2×3.

She invented the design for the 3c pieces, shown above, by dividing the edges of a cube into 12 sections, grouping 4 sets of 3 together symmetrically.

This is when Grant joined the server, and shared his 3D printed 2×2×2×2. Rowan then challenged him to build Luna's design for the 2×2×2×3. After a lot of time tweaking the designs, printing them, magnetizing them, and assembling them, the 2×2×2×3 was completed on February 3rd 2022.

## How Does it Work?

The 2x2x2x3 follows the same basic principles as [Melinda's 2×2×2×2](/puzzles/physical/2x2x2x2/index.md), except gyros get more complicated. Grant made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7on6xk9kq-g) showing off the legal twists, and how they exactly matched those of the virtual puzzle in MPU.
