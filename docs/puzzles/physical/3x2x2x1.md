    **4D Shape:** Hypercuboid

    **Physical Shape:** Cuboid

    **Pieces:** 8 5c, 4 4c

    **Magnets:** 512

    **Completed:** 2024 Jan 15

## History

Few days after completing physical 2x2x2x1 (on 2023-01-15) [Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) finished assembling four new 4c pieces that combined with previous 5c pieces are creating physical an analog of 3x2x2x1 puzzle. This one was another important mile stone on way to creating 3x3x3x1 puzzle.

## Moves

Legal moves of a layer include 3d 3x2x2 90° and 180° twists that rotate pieces without changing their 4d orientation, 4d 180° twists that beside moving pieces in 3d rotate them in 4d axis, or a combination of both.

## Solving

Beside basic stickers (white, yellow, orange, red, green, blue) every piece on a puzzle has pink and purle stickers which indcate in which 4d orientation the piece is. In solved state every piece must have the same 4d axis orientation.
3x2x2x1 puzzle is a bit more complicated than 3x2x2. Can be solved by: orienting 4c piece in 4d axis, orienting 5c pieces in 4d axis, solving the rest of the puzzle like 3d 3x2x2. Tymon made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TytFuKXL_Xg) showing example solve of the puzzle.
