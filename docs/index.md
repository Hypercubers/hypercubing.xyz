# Hypercubing

Hypercubing is a niche branch of Rubik's Cubing that focuses on solving [higher dimensional twisty puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_sequential_move_puzzle). The ways that twisty puzzles move are mathematically well defined, and can be generalized to higher spatial dimensions. These puzzles can then be visualized and simulated using [computer software](/software).

The most well known 4D shape is the [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) (also called the tesseract, 8-cell, octachoron, or 4-cube). It has 8 cubic sides that are called cells. Turning any of the cells involves rotating it like a cube to any of 24 orientations.

The short article [Abstracting the Rubik's Cube](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Mathhorizons/pdfs/AbstractingRubiks_MH_25.4.18.pdf) introduces a number of the hypercubing puzzles.
