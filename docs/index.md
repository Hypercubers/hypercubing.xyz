Hypercubing is the hobby of solving twisty puzzles (such as the Rubik's cube) in [higher dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_sequential_move_puzzle). The ways that twisty puzzles move are mathematically well defined, and can be generalized to higher spatial dimensions. These puzzles can then be visualized and simulated using [computer software](/software/index.md).

The most well known 4D shape is the [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) (also called the tesseract, 8-cell, octachoron, or 4-cube). It has 8 cubic sides that are called cells. Turning any of the cells involves rotating it like a cube to any of 24 orientations.

Another definition of hypercubing is "beyond cubing." This includes all manner of exotic twisty puzzles beyond the handful of puzzles solved by most speedcubers.

The short article [Abstracting Rubik's Cube](http://roice3.org/papers/abstracting_rubiks_cube.pdf) introduces a number of the hypercubing puzzles.
