## Download/installation

Magic Cube 4D requires [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) to be installed. Once you have Java, go to the [Superliminal website](https://superliminal.com/cube/) and click on the `Click here to download MagicCube4D` button. Save the executable `mc4d-4-3-343.jar` file somewhere you will remember, as this file is how you open the program.

## Alternative versions

### Raynefork

Raynefork is Raymond Zhao's version of MC4D, which has the updated default colour scheme (standard 3^3^ colours plus pink/purple), and some more options in the settings menu. It can be found from its GitHub [here](https://github.com/rzhao271/magiccube4d/releases/tag/v4.3.343-raynefork.2.1).

### Don's version

Don's version contains some 2D puzzles, many 3D puzzles, and some interesting 4D puzzles. It also has a menu for 5D and 6D puzzles, however they don't work when you select them. Don's version can be downloaded from its GitHub [here](https://github.com/donhatch/donhatchsw.jar/blob/master/java1.8/donhatchsw.jar).


## Troubleshooting

Try reading [MC4D's FAQ](https://superliminal.com/cube/faq.html) on the superliminal website. If you're still having an issue, try asking for help on the Discord server or mailing list.

??? warning "my computer wants to open the `.jar` file with notepad"
    This means that you haven't installed Java properly. Make sure to get the newest version from [Java's website](https://www.java.com/en/). After the installation, right click on the `mc4d-4-3-343.jar` file, and click `open with Java(TM) Platform SE Binary`.

??? warning "facecolors.txt doesn't change my colors"
    1. Try closing and reopening the program, and then reloading the puzzle using the menu.
    2. If you're on windows and you have show file extensions off in settings, then you may have accidentally named the file `facecolors.txt.txt`. Try renaming it to just `facecolors`. (Alternatively, enable show file extensions in settings)
