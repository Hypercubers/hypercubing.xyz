Just like 3D reduction of big cubes, higher dimensional reduction works by pairing up groups of pieces with more and more colors until the *n*^d^ is reduced into an (*n-1*)^d^. Pairing up pieces is done in a very similar way to the 3D method; If you can solve 3^3^, 4^3^, and 3^4^, then you can solve 4^4^.
