# Orozco
Orozco is a method one can use to solve the 2x2x2x2 Blindfolded. It works by cycling 2 corners with one target corner using RKT and setup moves. This makes it relatively straightforward to execute, as one can usually find an intuitive way to swap the pieces.

# Prerequisite Knowledge
Before learning 2x2x2x2 Orozco, you should be familiar with the following: General Blind solving, 3x3x3 Orozco, General 4D solving, Commutator Construction, 4D Blind Solving Principles.

# Setting Pieces Up
Use whichever buffer and helper you find best, but a common combination is IUFR and IUBR. To make the swap easier, set the target piece up to the I cell, ideally in a way that makes an RKT 8 move commutator possible.

# Swapping Pieces
To swap pieces, simply do an RKT commutator of those pieces. 

# Optimizations
If a cycle break is necessary, find the helper buffer piece and swap to that. This ensures that that piece won't need to be twisted at the end of the solve. As previously mentioned, set pieces up so that an RKT 8 move commutator is possible.
