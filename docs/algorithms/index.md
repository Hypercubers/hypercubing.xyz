This page lists resources for various 4D+ algorithms.

!!! warning "These won't help you solve a puzzle for the first time"
    Please note that you do not *need* to learn additional algorithms for hypercubing to get started. These are for speedsolving at an advanced level and shave off mere seconds or fractions of a seconds off of solve times.
